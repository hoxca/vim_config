# Vim Configuration

Derived from mutwinter dot_vim 
=> too much plugins reduce my productivity 

## Installation

1. `git clone http://github.com/hoxca/vim_config.git` in your home folder.
2. `mv vim_config .vim`
3. `cd .vim`
4. `rake vim:install` to make the .vimrc symbolic link. install vundle and all plugins
5. `rake vim:commandt` to compile commandt 
    make sure that vim has +ruby support
7. Enjoy

## Requirements

**Mac**

 * [MacVim](https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim) - I'm currently using [snapshot 64](https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim/downloads)

**Linux**

 * [Vim-Nox] on Ubuntu as far as it's compiled with ruby support ! 

## Notes

Be sure to always edit the vimrc using `,v`, which opens the vimrc in the .vim folder. Vim has a nasty habit of overriding symlinks.

## Plugin Installation / Requirements

I may make this more verbose later, but for now, here's a list of plugins that require further installation:

 * [syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) Requires many different binaries installed depending on what filetypes you want it to check.
 * [Monaco patched for Powerline] Provided in config folder
